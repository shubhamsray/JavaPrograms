# Java Programs Repository

This repository contains various Java programs that demonstrate essential Java concepts and algorithms. Each program addresses a specific problem or concept, such as data structures, algorithms, or object-oriented programming (OOP). Below is a list of all the programs included, along with their brief explanations.

## 1. HashMap Implementation
- **Description:** This program implements a basic `HashMap` in Java. It demonstrates key-value pair storage, adding, updating, and retrieving values, as well as iteration over the entries.

## 2. Reverse of a String
- **Description:** This program takes a string as input and outputs the reversed version of the string by iterating through the characters.

## 3. Reverse of a String using HashMap
- **Description:** This program demonstrates how to reverse a string by storing its characters in a `HashMap`, using indices as keys and characters as values.

## 4. Palindrome Check
- **Description:** This program checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). It uses both iterative and recursive approaches.

## 5. Fibonacci Series
- **Description:** This program generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. It uses both iterative loops and recursion for generating the sequence.

## 6. Factorial Calculation
- **Description:** This program calculates the factorial of a given number using both iterative loops and recursion.

## 7. Armstrong Number
- **Description:** This program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is one that equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

## 8. Arithmetic and Geometric Progression
- **Description:** This program computes the terms of an arithmetic progression (AP) and geometric progression (GP) given the initial term and common difference/ratio.

## 9. Reverse a Number
- **Description:** This program reverses the digits of a given number. For example, if the input is `1234`, the output will be `4321`.

## 10. Sum of All Elements in an Array
- **Description:** This program calculates the sum of all elements in an integer array. It uses simple iteration through the array to compute the total.

## 11. Searching an Element in Array and Finding the Maximum Element
- **Description:** This program searches for a specific element in an array and also finds the maximum element in the array.

## 12. Find the Second Largest Element in an Array
- **Description:** This program finds the second largest element in an array by iterating through the array and keeping track of the largest and second largest values.

## 13. Rotating an Array
- **Description:** This program rotates an array to the right or left by a specified number of positions, using array manipulation techniques.

## 14. Reverse an Array
- **Description:** This program reverses the elements of an array in place, swapping elements from the beginning with those from the end.

## 15. Increase the Size of an Array
- **Description:** This program demonstrates how to increase the size of an array dynamically by creating a new array and copying the elements from the old array.

## 16. Adding and Multiplying Two Matrices
- **Description:** This program performs matrix addition and matrix multiplication. It takes two matrices as input and outputs their sum and product, provided the dimensions are appropriate for the operations.

## 17. Sorting an Array
- **Description:** This program sorts an array using common sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## 18. Prime Number Check
- **Description:** This program checks whether a given number is prime. It efficiently checks divisibility and determines if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

## 19. Rotating an Array Element from the Left
- **Description:** This program rotates an array's elements to the left by a specified number of positions.

## 20. Copying an Array
- **Description:** This program demonstrates how to copy elements from one array to another, either using a loop or the `System.arraycopy` method.

## 21. Prime Number Check (Duplicate Program)
- **Description:** This is an alternative implementation of the prime number check program, demonstrating another method to achieve the same result.

## 22. Constructor, Overloading, Overriding, Abstract Classes, and Interface Demonstration
- **Description:** This program demonstrates OOP concepts such as constructor overloading, method overloading, method overriding, the use of abstract classes, and the implementation of interfaces. It showcases inheritance and polymorphism in Java.

## 23. Exception Handling (Try and Catch)
- **Description:** This program demonstrates Java's exception handling mechanism using `try` and `catch` blocks. It handles common runtime exceptions and shows how to prevent the program from crashing.

## 24. HashMap and Queue Demonstration
- **Description:** This program demonstrates how to use a `HashMap` for key-value storage and a `Queue` for handling elements in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. It highlights how to perform operations like enqueue, dequeue, and hashmap retrievals.

## 25. AWT, Swing, or JavaFX Program
- **Description:** This program demonstrates Java's GUI capabilities using either AWT, Swing, or JavaFX. It creates a simple user interface with buttons, text fields, and labels, showcasing basic event handling.
